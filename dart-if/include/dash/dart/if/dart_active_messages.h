/**
 * Try to send an active message to unit \c target through message queue \c amsgq.
 * At the target, a task will be created that executes \c fn with arguments \c data.
 * The argument data of size \c data_size will be copied to the target unit's message queue.
 * The call fails if there is not sufficient space available in the target's message queue.
 *
 * Implementation: The queue is shortly locked through a compare_and_swap atomic to determine
 *                 the position in the queue and update the queue tail using fetch_and_op.
 *                 The queue is then released before the actual message is copied.
 *
 * Note: Although the built-in notification of dart_locks, We do not use them since:
 *       1) One global lock would potentially harm performance (no two message queues could be used at the same time)
 *       2) We would need N locks for fine-grained locking (leading to O(N) required memory per unit and O(N^2) global memory)
 *
 * Note: All data required to execute the function contained in the active message must be contained in the data argument,
 *       i.e., no external references can be handled at the moment.
